# 🚀 How to Deploy to GitHub

I have already configured the remote repository for you.

## One Final Step: Push!

Run this single command in your terminal to send your code to GitHub:

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

*(You may be asked to sign in to GitHub in a browser window)*

## Configuration Details (Already Done)
- **Remote URL**: `https://github.com/DhanushGCode/AI-Powered-Security-Monitoring-Threat-Detection-Platform.git`
- **Branch**: `main`

## Troubleshooting
If the repository doesn't exist yet on GitHub, you need to:
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `AI-Powered-Security-Monitoring-Threat-Detection-Platform`
3. Click **Create repository**
4. Then run the `git push` command above.
